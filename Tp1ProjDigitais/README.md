Processor inspired by the Intel 4004, with a 4-bit ALU and registers and instructions with one or two 8-bit words.

A minimal subset of 46 instructions from the Intel 4004 was used, allowing the implementation of a program to calculate the value of the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence (n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ... 7), the result must fit in 4 bits.

Made with logism.
